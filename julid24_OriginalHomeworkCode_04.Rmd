# Problem 1
Write a simple R function, Z.prop.test(), that can perform one or two sample Z-tests for proportion data using the following guidelines:  
-- p1 and n1 (no default) representing the estimated proportion and sample size
-- p2 and n2 (both defaulting to NULL) that contain a second sample's proportion and sample size data in the even of a two-sample test
-- pO (no default) as the expected value for the population proportion
-- alternative default "two.sided" and conf.level (default 0.95) used in the same way as in t.test()

```{r}
Z.prop.test <- function(p1, n1, p2=NULL, n2=NULL, p0, alternative="two.sided", conf.level=0.95)
```
